# Runewords

[Production Site](http://diablo2runewords.herokuapp.com/api/v1/runewords)

## Objective

Diablo 2 has an overly complex item system and one of those unnecessary
complexities is Runewords. There is no place online for understanding runewords
with nice search tools and simplicity (not 200 ads about Diablo 3).

I aim to fix that with my unoffical Runewords API and this web based front end.

### API

I crafted the API using data from various sources (needs citation). What I came
up with lives here:

### Implementation Details

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.14.0.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
